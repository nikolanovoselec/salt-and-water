### Reading Inquiries

Guest inquiries arrive by email to hello@graymatter.ch. The D1 database also stores all inquiries as a backup log accessible via the admin panel.

## Content Guidelines

- **Photos:** Minimum 1200px wide for hero use. JPEG or HEIC from phone camera is fine — Cloudflare handles format conversion.
- **Text:** Write naturally. Croatian can be warmer and more familiar. German should be precise with exact distances.
- **Locales:** Content can be published per locale independently. Unpublished locales fall back to Croatian.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Authentication failed":** Clear browser cookies for the site, then try logging in again. Make sure you're using one of the authorized Google accounts.
- **Changes not visible:** Pages are edge-cached. Changes may take up to 1 hour to appear. Force refresh with Ctrl+Shift+R.
- **Can't upload photos:** Check file size (max 15MB). Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, HEIC, WebP.

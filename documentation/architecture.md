# Architecture

System overview, component map, and data flow for Apartmani Pašman.

**Audience:** Developers

---

## Overview

Apartmani Pašman is a server-side rendered Astro site deployed as a Cloudflare Worker. It serves a multilingual vacation rental website with an owner-facing admin panel. There is no separate backend service — all logic runs at the edge inside the Worker.

## Components

### Runtime

| Component | Role |
|---|---|
| Cloudflare Worker | Hosts the entire application (Astro SSR via `@astrojs/cloudflare`) |
| Cloudflare D1 | SQLite-compatible edge database — auth codes, sessions, inquiries, availability blocks, analytics events, slug redirects |
| Cloudflare R2 | Private object storage for uploaded media (`apartmani-media` bucket) |
| Cloudflare Image Resizing | Edge image transforms — AVIF/WebP conversion, resizing, HEIC support |
| Resend | Transactional email — magic link codes, inquiry notifications |
| Cloudflare Turnstile | Bot protection on public forms |
| Emdash CMS | Embedded CMS integration mounted at `/_emdash/` |

### Source Modules

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/i18n/` | Locale config, translation loader (`t()`), format helpers |
| `src/lib/auth.ts` | JWT signing/verification, code generation, refresh tokens |
| `src/lib/availability.ts` | Half-open interval overlap logic for booking calendar |
| `src/lib/pricing.ts` | Season-based price computation, tourist tax, cleaning fee |
| `src/lib/media.ts` | R2 URL builder (`buildMediaUrl`) and srcset helper |
| `src/lib/resend.ts` | Fetch-based Resend email client — used by inquiry and custom admin login flows |
| `src/lib/turnstile.ts` | Server-side Turnstile token verification |
| `src/lib/content.ts` | Emdash CMS helpers — `getLocalizedCollection`, `getLocalizedEntry`, `getSettings` with locale fallback to Croatian. `getLocalizedCollection` paginates through all Emdash pages (cursor-based, 100 entries per request) to guarantee the full dataset is returned regardless of collection size. |
| `src/lib/hreflang.ts` | `buildHreflangLinks(pathname, siteOrigin)` — builds `<link rel="alternate" hreflang>` objects for all four locales plus `x-default`; used in the `<head>` of every page |
| `src/lib/schema.ts` | Schema.org JSON-LD builders — `buildVacationRentalSchema(apartment, locale)` and `buildBreadcrumbSchema(items)`; consumed by apartment detail pages |
| `src/lib/sanitize.ts` | Input sanitization — HTML stripping, email header injection prevention |
| `src/schemas/inquiry.ts` | Zod schemas for booking and quick-question form submissions |
| `src/middleware/` | Request pipeline: redirects → locale → security headers |
| `src/pages/api/img/[key].ts` | Image serving route — fetches from R2 via Emdash storage or direct bucket access; applies `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`; key is an extension-free UUID |
| `src/pages/admin/api/` | Auth API endpoints (login, verify, upload-url) |
| `src/pages/admin/api/inquiries/[id]/confirm.ts` | Confirm booking inquiry and block dates atomically |
| `src/pages/api/apartments/[id]/availability.ts` | Availability API — returns booked dates for calendar display |
| `src/pages/api/inquiry.ts` | Inquiry submission — full booking pipeline (validate, persist, email) |
| `src/pages/api/track.ts` | Analytics API — cookieless event logging to D1 |
| `src/layouts/` | Base and Page layout shells |
| `src/components/shell/` | Navigation (desktop nav + mobile hamburger menu with `is:inline` script to avoid Astro bundler stripping), Footer, LanguageSwitcher, WhatsAppButton, StickyMobileCTA |
| `src/components/home/Hero.astro` | Hero carousel — 7 island photos served from R2 via `/api/img/:uuid`, crossfade (1.8s CSS transition), continuous zoom animation (`heroZoom` keyframe: 12s ease-in-out infinite alternate, scale 1→1.1 with -1%/-1% translate, paused until slide is active), auto-advance every 6 s, dot navigation, hover-pause; implemented as `is:inline` script; all image keys are extension-free UUIDs |
| `src/components/home/ScrollCollage.astro` | Infinite-scroll exterior photo strip — accepts `images: Array<{ src: string; alt: string }>` and optional `speed` (default 35 s). Renders two copies of the image set side-by-side so CSS `translateX(-50%)` creates a seamless loop. Hover pauses animation. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` by disabling the keyframe and falling back to an overflow-scrollable row. Photos are sourced from a CMS `editorial` entry with `section_key=collage` (body field = JSON array of `{src, alt}` objects). Emdash auto-parses any body value that begins with `[` or `{`, so `data.body` may arrive as an already-parsed array or as a string — `parseCollageBody` in `index.astro` handles both. Collage is hidden if the CMS entry is absent. |
| `src/components/ui/HeroSimple.astro` | Interior page hero — used on all non-homepage pages including apartment detail. Props: `title` (required), `subtitle` (optional, displayed as small-caps label), `image` (optional URL). When `image` is provided, the photo fills the hero with a slow 20 s zoom (`heroSimpleZoom` keyframe: scale 1→1.06, ease-in-out infinite alternate) and a dark navy gradient overlay. Without `image`, falls back to a static dark navy radial-gradient background. An inline SVG wave (cream `#F8F5EF`) is always rendered at the bottom of the section to merge visually with the page background. |
| `src/components/ui/WaveDivider.astro` | Full-width SVG wave divider between sections. Props: `fill` (wave color, default `#F8F5EF`), `flip` (boolean, flips vertically via `scaleY(-1)` for wave-out effect), `class`. Height is fluid: `clamp(40px, 6vw, 80px)`. Used in pairs on the homepage to bracket the dark navy section and the sunset CTA section. |
| `src/styles/global.css` | Design system — CSS custom properties, typography scale, layout utilities, component classes, animation utilities |

## Request Lifecycle

```
Browser → Cloudflare edge
  → Worker (Astro SSR)
    → redirectsMiddleware   (trailing slash normalization)
    → localeMiddleware      (extract/validate locale from URL prefix)
    → headersMiddleware     (CSP, X-Frame-Options, security headers)
    → Page handler / API route
      → D1 / R2 / external service calls
    → Response
```

## Locale Routing

All public pages are prefixed with the locale: `/hr/`, `/de/`, `/sl/`, `/en/`. Croatian (`hr`) is the default. The root path `/` redirects to the detected locale via `Accept-Language` header. The locale middleware sets `locals.locale` for downstream use. API, media, and admin routes bypass locale middleware entirely.

Astro's i18n is configured with `routing: "manual"`. File-based `[locale]` directories handle all locale resolution; Astro does not automatically prefix or rewrite any routes. Manual mode is required to prevent Astro from localizing integration-injected routes such as Emdash's `/_emdash/admin` — with automatic `prefixDefaultLocale` routing, Astro would move that page to `/hr/_emdash/admin`, causing the `[locale]` handler to receive `_emdash` as the locale and return 404. See [AD13](decisions/README.md#ad13-switch-to-manual-i18n-routing-to-prevent-astro-from-rewriting-integration-injected-routes).

### Public Page Routes

| Route | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/:locale/` | `src/pages/[locale]/index.astro` | Homepage — emits a `LodgingBusiness` Schema.org JSON-LD block inline (address: Fratarsko 5, Ždrelac; geo: 44.010669, 15.285480; amenities: Wi-Fi, Parking, Air conditioning, BBQ) |
| `/:locale/apartmani` | `src/pages/[locale]/apartmani/index.astro` | Apartment listing — card grid (2 columns desktop, 1 mobile); CMS-only; each card links to detail page. Below the grid, a `ScrollCollage` strip renders exterior photos sourced from the same `editorial` CMS entry (`page_key=homepage`, `section_key=collage`) used on the homepage; hidden when the CMS entry is absent. |
| `/:locale/apartmani/:slug` | `src/pages/[locale]/apartmani/[slug].astro` | Apartment detail — `HeroSimple` (title + tagline + hero image), breadcrumbs, interior photo strip (`MiniCollage` at speed 25, sourced from `gallery` CMS field, wrapped in `.editorial-strip`), description, meta grid (sleeps/bedrooms/size/beach distance), price card, amenity list; fetches entry directly by slug via `getEmDashEntry("apartments", slug)` with no locale filtering (locale is applied in rendering, not in lookup); redirects to listing on missing slug |
| `/:locale/zdrelac` | `src/pages/[locale]/zdrelac.astro` | Ždrelac village — CMS-only: queries `editorial` collection for `page_key === "zdrelac"`, sorted by `sort_order`; renders no content rows if CMS entries absent; image column is conditional (only rendered when `image` field is non-empty); localized in all 4 locales; linked from main nav |
| `/:locale/galerija` | `src/pages/[locale]/galerija.astro` | Gallery — masonry grid of location and apartment photos with lightbox; linked from main nav |
| `/:locale/zasto-pasman` | `src/pages/[locale]/zasto-pasman.astro` | Why Pašman — CMS-only: queries `editorial` collection for `page_key === "why-pasman"`, sorted by `sort_order`; each entry maps to one content row via `title`, `body`, and `image` fields; renders no content rows if CMS entries absent; not in main nav |
| `/:locale/dolazak` | `src/pages/[locale]/dolazak.astro` | Getting Here — CMS-only: queries `editorial` collection for `page_key === "dolazak"`, sorted by `sort_order`; each entry maps to one alternating content-row section via `title`, `body`, and `image` fields; a hardcoded address block (`Fratarsko 3, 23271 Ždrelac, Croatia`) with Google Maps and Apple Maps deep-link buttons is always rendered below the CMS sections; renders no content rows if CMS entries absent |
| `/:locale/faq` | `src/pages/[locale]/faq.astro` | FAQ — accordion with Schema.org FAQPage markup (not in main nav) |
| `/:locale/o-nama` | `src/pages/[locale]/o-nama.astro` | About Us — CMS-only: queries `editorial` collection for `page_key === "about"`; renders `body` field as host story; renders empty if CMS entry absent |
| `/:locale/vodic` | `src/pages/[locale]/vodic.astro` | Local Guide — queries `editorial` collection for `page_key === "vodic"` (sorted by `sort_order`) only; rendered as a responsive card grid (1 col mobile, 2 col ≥640px, 3 col ≥1024px) where each card is a 4:3 image with a text overlay and hover zoom; localized in all 4 locales; includes a Zadar section (Sea Organ, Sun Salutation) |
| `/:locale/hrana` | `src/pages/[locale]/hrana.astro` | Food & Drink — CMS-only: queries `editorial` collection for `page_key === "hrana"`, sorted by `sort_order`; page-hero + alternating content-row layout; renders no content rows if CMS entries absent; localized in all 4 locales; linked from homepage triptych |
| `/:locale/aktivnosti` | `src/pages/[locale]/aktivnosti.astro` | Nature & Activities — CMS-only: queries `editorial` collection for `page_key === "aktivnosti"`, sorted by `sort_order`; renders no content rows if CMS entries absent; image column is conditional (only rendered when `image` field is non-empty); page-hero + alternating content-row layout; localized in all 4 locales; linked from homepage triptych |
| `/:locale/plaze` | `src/pages/[locale]/plaze.astro` | Beaches — CMS-only: queries `editorial` collection for `page_key === "plaze"`, sorted by `sort_order`; renders no content rows if CMS entries absent; image column is conditional (only rendered when `image` field is non-empty); page-hero + alternating content-row layout; localized in all 4 locales; linked from homepage triptych |
| `/:locale/kontakt` | `src/pages/[locale]/kontakt.astro` | Contact — standalone inquiry form with Turnstile CAPTCHA, honeypot, and GDPR consent checkbox; submits as `type: "question"` to `POST /api/inquiry`; all CTA links across the site point here |
| `/:locale/privatnost` | `src/pages/[locale]/privatnost.astro` | Privacy Policy (GDPR) — CMS-controlled body (page_key `"privacy"`); fallback includes processor list (Cloudflare D1/R2/Turnstile, Resend); linked from the GDPR consent checkbox on the contact form |
| `/404` | `src/pages/404.astro` | Custom 404 — locale-aware (detects locale from URL prefix, falls back to `hr`); full-bleed sunset photo background served from R2 via `/api/img/:uuid`, localized title + flavour text, three nav links (homepage, apartments, contact) |

`/:locale` is one of `hr`, `de`, `sl`, `en`.

## Media Pipeline

All photos — editorial, hero, apartment interior, and gallery — are stored in the `apartmani-media` R2 bucket and served via `/api/img/:key`. There is no `public/photos/` directory; no photos are committed to the repository.

### Image serving route

`src/pages/api/img/[key].ts` handles `GET /api/img/:uuid` requests. The key is an extension-free UUID. The route first attempts retrieval via `locals.emdash.storage.download(key)` (the Emdash storage abstraction over the same R2 bucket). On failure it falls back to direct `env.MEDIA` bucket access. Both paths return `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`.

Key validation rejects empty keys, path traversal sequences (`..`), and leading slashes.

All image keys across the codebase — hero carousel, editorial D1 entries, gallery JSON fields, and CMS references — use the UUID format exclusively. No descriptive slug keys exist in source code or production data. See [AD15](decisions/README.md#ad15-all-r2-image-keys-standardized-to-uuid-format) for the standardization decision.

### Owner uploads

Direct browser-to-R2 uploads use presigned PUT URLs generated by `POST /admin/api/upload-url` via `aws4fetch` signed with R2 S3-compatible credentials. The returned `key` is a `UUID.ext` string; callers strip the extension when constructing `/api/img/:uuid` URLs. See [AD12](decisions/README.md#ad12-all-photos-migrated-to-r2-served-via-apiimguuid) for the migration decision.

## Authentication Model

The admin panel uses Magic Link auth. See [Authentication](authentication.md) for the full flow.

## Pricing Model

Season-based pricing supports cross-season stays. Tourist tax is applied per taxable person per night (adults + children 12–17; children under 12 exempt). Cleaning fee is flat. See `src/lib/pricing.ts` for `computeStayPrice()`.

## Availability Model

Bookings are stored as half-open intervals `[checkIn, checkOut)`. The checkout day is available for new check-ins. Overlap detection uses the condition: `proposed.checkIn < block.checkOut AND proposed.checkOut > block.checkIn`. The `availability_blocks` table stores blocks by apartment ID with `source` tracking (`manual | ics | inquiry`). The calendar API at `GET /api/apartments/:id/availability` expands blocks into individual booked dates for display.

## Analytics Model

Cookieless analytics events are logged to the D1 `events` table via `POST /api/track`. No PII is stored — only event type, apartment slug, locale, page path, and timestamp. Valid event types: `inquiry_submit`, `question_submit`, `whatsapp_click`, `call_click`, `apartment_view`, `gallery_open`, `language_switch`, `calendar_select`.

## Inquiry Pipeline

Inquiries are stored in D1 `inquiries` table covering the full lifecycle: `new → read → responded → confirmed | declined | spam`. Email delivery status is tracked separately (`pending → sent | retry | failed`) with retry metadata. The D1 record is the source of truth for status; email is the primary notification channel (see [AD6](decisions/README.md#ad6-inquiry-lifecycle-via-email-first-d1-as-backup-log)).

### Submission Flow (POST /api/inquiry)

```
Browser submits form
  → Turnstile verification (server-side, 10s timeout)
  → Honeypot check (silent fake-success on bot)
  → Zod schema validation (discriminated union: booking | question)
  → Input sanitization (stripHtml, sanitizeEmail, stripUrls, etc.)
  → [booking only] Server-side availability overlap recheck → 409 if stale
  → [booking only] Price estimate from seasons table
  → INSERT INTO inquiries (status='new', email_status='pending')
  → Resend: owner notification + guest auto-reply
  → UPDATE inquiries SET email_status='sent'|'retry'
  → INSERT INTO events (type='inquiry_submit'|'question_submit')
  → 200 (email sent) or 202 (email failed, inquiry saved)
```

### Confirmation Flow (POST /admin/api/inquiries/:id/confirm)

```
Admin triggers confirm
  → JWT auth check (auth_token cookie) → 401 if missing or invalid
  → Lookup inquiry by ID → 404 if missing
  → Guard: type must be 'booking' → 400 if question
  → Guard: status must not be 'confirmed' → 409 if already done
  → Step 1 — D1 batch (INSERT only):
      INSERT INTO availability_blocks ... WHERE NOT EXISTS (overlap)
        → 0 rows inserted = 409 date_conflict, status NOT updated
  → Step 2 — only if INSERT succeeded:
      UPDATE inquiries SET status='confirmed'
  → 200 success
```

Overlap detection is embedded in the INSERT statement itself (`INSERT...WHERE NOT EXISTS`), not as a separate pre-check. The INSERT runs alone in a D1 `batch()` so its result can be checked before the status update executes. If `meta.changes === 0` the function returns `409` and the UPDATE is never reached — preventing the previous failure mode where the UPDATE ran unconditionally in the same batch even when no block was written.

## Seed Data Structure

The live D1 database is the source of truth for all CMS content. The `seed/seed.json` file and its `/api/admin/seed` endpoint have been removed; content is managed directly via the Emdash admin panel and via SQL migration scripts in `sql/`. The collections below reflect the current live data structure.

### Collections

| Collection slug | Entries | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pages` | ~32 | Static editorial pages in all 4 locales — Why Pašman, Getting Here, About, Privacy, etc. Each entry has `locale`, `page_key`, `title`, `subtitle`, `body` (richtext), and `hero_image`. Note: several pages query the `editorial` collection (not `pages`) by `page_key`. All content pages are CMS-only with no hardcoded fallback — `zasto-pasman.astro`, `dolazak.astro`, `o-nama.astro`, `hrana.astro`, `zdrelac.astro`, `aktivnosti.astro`, and `plaze.astro` all render empty content until matching `editorial` entries are seeded. |
| `editorial` | 92 (23 × 4 locales) | Content rows for all editorial pages. Restructured from ~42 entries to 23 across 6 pages (3-4 sections each): `hrana` (4), `aktivnosti` (4), `plaze` (4), `zdrelac` (4), `dolazak` (3), `vodic` (4, includes Zadar section). Each entry: `page_key`, `section_key`, `sort_order`, `locale`, `title`, `body`, `image` (UUID path), `gallery` (JSON array of `{src, alt}` objects with UUID paths). Migration scripts in `sql/restructure-editorial*.sql`. |
| `homepage` | ~16 | Homepage section overrides per locale. Each entry has a `section_key` that maps to a block on the homepage. Known section keys: `why-pasman` (title + body text), `zdrelac` (village feature title), `apartments` (title + body for the dark section), `cta` (call-to-action heading), `collage` (exterior photo strip — `body` field contains a JSON array of `{"src": "/api/img/uuid", "alt": "..."}` objects consumed by `ScrollCollage`). The `collage` entry is locale-independent (all locales share the same photo list); absent entry hides the collage strip. |
| `apartments` | 2 | Apartment detail pages per locale — slugs `lavanda-{locale}` and `tramuntana-{locale}`. **Lavanda** = ground floor apartment (owner: Nikola). **Tramuntana** = upper floor apartment (owner: Marko). Structured fields: capacity, bedrooms, amenities, bed config, distances, per-locale name/description/SEO. Gallery managed via `gallery_json` field (JSON array of `/api/img/uuid` paths). |
| `faq` | ~20 | FAQ entries in all 4 locales — `locale`, `question`, `answer` (richtext), `sort_order`. |
| `guide` | ~16 | Local guide entries (beaches, food, activities, day trips) per locale — `locale`, `category`, `title`, `description`, `image_url`. Not used by `vodic.astro` (which now reads only the `editorial` collection). |
| `testimonials` | 6 | Guest testimonials linked to apartments — `guest_name`, `country`, `rating`, `quote`, `apartment_id`, `is_featured`. |
| `amenities` | ~10 | Amenity definitions — `slug`, `icon`, `label` per locale. |

All content is loaded at runtime via `src/lib/content.ts` helpers (`getLocalizedCollection`, `getLocalizedEntry`), which filter entries by locale and fall back to Croatian (`hr`) if the requested locale has no entries. `getLocalizedCollection` exhausts cursor-based pagination before filtering, so all entries in a collection are always considered regardless of how many pages Emdash returns.

## Design System

The entire visual language lives in `src/styles/global.css` as CSS custom properties on `:root`. No CSS-in-JS, no utility framework — component classes are defined once and composed in markup.

| `.wave-separator` | Full-width SVG wave between sections — 60px tall container with an absolutely positioned inline SVG child; used in pairs (normal + `.wave-sep--flip`) to create a wave-in / wave-out effect |
| `.wave-divider` | Styles produced by `src/components/ui/WaveDivider.astro` — full-width block, `line-height: 0`, `overflow: hidden`; child SVG fills 100% width at `clamp(40px, 6vw, 80px)` height; `.wave-divider--flip` applies `scaleY(-1)` for the wave-out direction |
| `.img-organic` | Image wrapper with alternating corner radii (`20px 4px 20px 4px`) for an organic, hand-cut feel; child `<img>` fills 100% with `object-fit: cover` |
| `.img-blob` | Image wrapper with a CSS blob radius (`30% 70% 70% 30% / 30% 30% 70% 70%`) for fluid, asymmetric masking |
| `.img-padded` | Image wrapper with `--space-md` padding; child `<img>` gets `border-radius: 16px` and `--shadow-lg` |

| `.image-hover-zoom` | Wrapper that scales the child `<img>` to 1.05× on hover with a slow ease — used on apartment cards and gallery items |
| `.hero-simple` | Interior page hero section — `min-height: 50vh`, flexbox-centered, `overflow: hidden`; padding accounts for nav height |
| `.hero-simple__img` | Absolutely-positioned full-bleed photo inside `.hero-simple`; `object-fit: cover`; drives the `heroSimpleZoom` animation (20 s, scale 1→1.06, ease-in-out infinite alternate) |
| `.hero-simple__bg` | Fallback background when no image prop is passed — navy radial-gradient from azure at top to dark navy |
| `.hero-simple__overlay` | Dark navy gradient overlay (`z-index: 1`) that dims the photo for legible white text; always rendered when an image is present |
| `.hero-simple__wave` | Inline SVG wave pinned to `bottom: -1px` at `z-index: 3`; height `clamp(40px, 6vw, 80px)`; cream fill (`#F8F5EF`) blends the hero into the page background |
| `.hero-simple__subtitle` | Small-caps uppercase subtitle rendered beneath the `<h1>` — `--font-size-sm`, wide tracking, 50% white opacity |

### ScrollCollage CSS Classes

Scoped styles inside `src/components/home/ScrollCollage.astro`.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.scroll-collage` | Overflow-hidden outer container; `padding: var(--space-xl) 0`; full-width |
| `.scroll-collage__track` | Flex row of all items (original set + duplicate); `width: max-content`; drives `scroll-collage` keyframe (`translateX(0)` → `translateX(-50%)`, linear infinite); animation duration set via inline `style` prop |
| `.scroll-collage__item` | Individual photo tile; `flex-shrink: 0`; `border-radius: 16px`; `overflow: hidden` |
| `.scroll-collage__item img` | Fixed height (250 px mobile / 350 px ≥768 px), `width: auto`, `object-fit: cover` |

Hover on `.scroll-collage` pauses the animation via `animation-play-state: paused`. Under `prefers-reduced-motion`, the keyframe is removed and the container becomes a horizontally scrollable row with `scrollbar-width: none`.

### Homepage Photo Patterns

These layout components are defined as scoped styles in `src/pages/[locale]/index.astro`. They use organic rounded corners (not flat edge-to-edge) and uniform aspect ratios per pattern.

| Class | Pattern | Key rules |
|---|---|---|
| `.photo-strip` | Horizontal strip of three images at uniform 3:2 aspect ratio with rounded corners | `display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); gap: var(--space-md)`; each `.photo-strip__item` has `border-radius: 16px` (desktop 20px) and `overflow: hidden` |
| `.full-bleed-image` | Single image at 21:9 aspect with a gradient overlay and centered text | `aspect-ratio: 21/9`; child `.full-bleed-image__text` is absolute-positioned |
| `.duo-image` | Two images side by side at uniform 3:4 aspect, using `.img-organic` wrappers for curved corners | `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: var(--space-md)`; images wrapped in `.img-organic` which supplies alternating-corner radii |
| `.triptych` | Four-card grid at uniform 4:5 aspect with label overlays and rounded corners | `display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr)` on mobile, `repeat(4, 1fr)` from 768 px; `gap: var(--space-md)`; `.triptych__label` is absolute-positioned; items have `border-radius: 16px`; items are `<a>` elements linking to `/hrana`, `/aktivnosti`, `/plaze`, and `/vodic` |
| `.split-section` | Two-column layout: text (`__left`) + content (`__right`) | 50/50 columns on desktop, stacked on mobile; `.split-section--reverse` swaps column order |
| `.tag-row` | Horizontal wrapping row of inline tag chips | `display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: var(--space-sm)` |
| `.tag` | Individual chip inside a `.tag-row` | `border: 1px solid var(--color-border)`, small padding, `--font-size-xs` |

### Shared Editorial Page Layout Classes

These classes are defined as `is:global` styles inside `hrana.astro` and reused by `aktivnosti.astro` and `plaze.astro` via the same pattern.

| Class | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `.page-hero` | Full-bleed hero at `60vh` / min `400px` — image `object-fit: cover` with a navy gradient overlay anchored to bottom; used on editorial detail pages |
| `.page-hero__overlay` | Absolute-positioned overlay container aligning content to bottom-left via flexbox |
| `.page-hero__intro` | Intro paragraph beneath the `<h1>` — `--font-size-lg`, `max-width: 600px`, 80% white opacity |
| `.content-row` | Two-column alternating layout: image (`1fr`) + text (`1fr`) on desktop, stacked on mobile; odd-indexed rows use `.content-row--reverse` to swap order |
| `.content-row__image` | Image wrapper with organic corner radii (`20px 4px 20px 4px`), overflow hidden, box shadow, 4:3 aspect ratio, hover zoom (1.03×) |
| `.content-row__text` | Text column with responsive heading (`clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2.5rem)`) |

### Page-Specific Layout Classes

These classes are defined as scoped styles inside individual page components. They are not shared across pages.

| Class | Page | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `.apartments-grid` | `apartmani/index.astro` | Two-column card grid (1 col mobile, 2 col ≥768px); gap `--space-2xl` |
| `.apartment-card-link` | `apartmani/index.astro` | Full-card anchor wrapping image + content; `text-decoration: none` |
| `.apartment-card__image` | `apartmani/index.astro` | Image at 3:2 aspect ratio with hover scale (1.03×); badge overlay top-left |
| `.apartment-card__badge` | `apartmani/index.astro` | Navy pill showing `best_for` value |
| `.apartment-card__footer` | `apartmani/index.astro` | Row: serif price left, inquiry `.btn` right; top border separator |
| `.editorial-strip` | `apartmani/[slug].astro` | Wrapper around `MiniCollage` for the interior photo strip on apartment detail pages |
| `.apt-detail` | `apartmani/[slug].astro` | Two-column grid: main content (`1.5fr`) + sidebar (`1fr`); stacks on mobile |
| `.apt-meta` | `apartmani/[slug].astro` | 2×2 stone-background grid of key stats (sleeps, bedrooms, size, beach distance) |
| `.apt-price-card` | `apartmani/[slug].astro` | White card with shadow: price label + serif amount + inquiry CTA button |
| `.apt-amenities` | `apartmani/[slug].astro` | Stone-background card; amenity list in 2-column grid with checkmark pseudo-elements |
| `.guide-cards` | `vodic.astro` | CSS grid of card tiles — 1 column mobile, 2 columns ≥640px, 3 columns ≥1024px; gap `--space-md` |
| `.guide-card` | `vodic.astro` | Individual card — `position: relative`, 4:3 aspect ratio, `border-radius: 16px`, overflow hidden; child `<img>` scales to 1.06× on hover over 0.6 s |
| `.card-overlay` | `vodic.astro` | Absolute overlay pinned to card bottom; holds `.card-overlay__label` (entry title) and `.card-overlay__title` (entry description text) |

### Progressive Enhancement

Scroll reveal animations are gated on a `.reveal-ready` class that JavaScript adds to `<body>` after the page loads. Without JS, all content is visible at full opacity — no layout shift, no hidden text. See [AD11](decisions/README.md#ad11-scroll-animations-gated-on-reveal-ready-class) for the rationale.

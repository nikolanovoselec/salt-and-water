# Deployment

Dev setup, deployment steps, and Cloudflare resource provisioning.

**Audience:** Developers

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Wrangler CLI: `npm install` (included as devDependency)
- Cloudflare account with access to the `apartmani` Worker project

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Astro dev server (local, no Worker runtime)
```

Note: local dev does not emulate D1 or R2 bindings. For full Worker runtime testing, deploy to a preview environment.

## Apply D1 Migrations

All migrations live in `migrations/`. Apply them to the remote D1 database with:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply apartmani-db --remote
```

### Migration files

| File | Tables created |
|---|---|
| `migrations/0001_auth.sql` | `auth_codes`, `sessions` |
| `migrations/0002_availability.sql` | `availability_blocks`, `inquiries`, `events`, `redirects` |

Migrations are applied in order. The D1 `wrangler_migrations` table tracks which have been applied.

## Deploy to Production

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This runs `astro build && wrangler deploy`. The Worker is deployed to `apartmani` under the configured Cloudflare account.

Wrangler reads credentials from `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variables. The account ID is also committed in `wrangler.jsonc` (`eac400a0a3a3638c7c91fe2e7875756d`).

## Cloudflare Resource Setup

### D1 Database

The D1 database `apartmani-db` (`1b519a56-0c60-475b-a30d-34f845bcff41`) is provisioned. After any schema change:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 migrations apply apartmani-db --remote
```

### R2 Bucket

The `apartmani-media` bucket binding is defined in `wrangler.jsonc` but commented out pending R2 enablement in the Cloudflare dashboard. Once enabled:

1. Uncomment the `r2_buckets` block in `wrangler.jsonc`.
2. Uncomment the corresponding line in `astro.config.mjs`.
3. Redeploy.

### Secrets

Set all required secrets before first deploy. See [Configuration](configuration.md#secrets) for the full list and commands.

# Performance

Image serving, edge caching, bundle budget.

## Key Concepts

- **Image Resizing**: Cloudflare service transforming images on-the-fly at the edge — no Worker-side processing
- **Edge caching**: Static pages cached at Cloudflare's global edge network for sub-second delivery
- **Bundle budget**: Maximum JS size shipped to visitors (< 80KB gzipped)
- **Blurhash**: Compact placeholder encoding shown before full image loads

## Requirements

### REQ-PERF-1: Image Serving Pipeline

- **Intent:** Fast, beautiful images from phone photos without Worker-side processing
- **Applies To:** System
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Originals stored in private R2 (no processing in Worker — memory/CPU limits)
  - **Image delivery via Worker route** `GET /api/img/{key}?w=800&f=webp&q=80` — Worker fetches from private R2 (via Emdash storage abstraction with direct R2 fallback), applies Cloudflare Image Resizing via `cf: { image: { ... } }` on the response. Works with private buckets. Object keys are UUIDs (no file extensions). Keys containing path traversal sequences (`..`) or leading slashes are rejected with 400.
  - Responsive `<picture>` with `srcset` at 400, 800, 1200, 1920px widths
  - Format negotiation: AVIF > WebP > JPEG based on Accept header
  - **Blurhash:** Computed client-side in CMS admin UI for new uploads (lightweight JS library). Computed at seed time for preloaded content. Stored as metadata string in D1. (No background task or Worker-side computation.)
  - Lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`) below fold
  - Hero first image: `loading="eager"` + `<link rel="preload">` + `fetchpriority="high"`
  - Subsequent Ken Burns images: lazy-loaded in background after first paint
  - **Failure modes:**
    - Image Resizing unavailable: fall back to original image from R2 (larger but functional)
    - Original not found in R2: show blurhash placeholder with alt text. No broken image icon.
    - Blurhash missing: show solid color placeholder (dominant palette color from CSS custom properties)
  - Target: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1
- **Constraints:** CON-PERF, CON-MEDIA
- **Priority:** P0
- **Dependencies:** REQ-CMS-2
- **Verification:** Lighthouse audit on 4G throttle
- **Status:** Partial — R2 serving route implemented at `/api/img/[key]` with long-lived immutable cache headers and error handling. Fetches via Emdash storage abstraction with direct R2 bucket fallback. 68 real photos uploaded to R2 with UUID keys. All site images (hero, subpage heroes, gallery, content) served from R2 via `/api/img/{key}`. R2 access credentials (`R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) configured as Worker secrets. Zero stock photos remain. Image Resizing (`cf: { image }`) not yet applied (currently serves originals). Blurhash, responsive `<picture>`, and format negotiation not yet implemented.

### REQ-PERF-2: Edge Caching

- **Intent:** Sub-second responses worldwide
- **Applies To:** System
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Static pages (homepage, apartments, editorial) cached at edge with `stale-while-revalidate`
  - **Root `/` is NOT shared-cacheable** — performs personalized locale redirect (`302`) based on: 1) locale cookie, 2) `Accept-Language`, 3) Croatian default
  - Dynamic routes (admin, API, form submission, `/api/track`, `/api/apartments/*/availability`) bypass cache
  - **Availability calendar data fetched client-side** via uncached API endpoint. Calendar shell renders statically; dates/pricing loaded on mount via JS. Prevents stale availability in cached pages.
  - Cache purged on content update from CMS (via Cache API)
  - Media from R2 via Image Resizing: cached at edge with long TTL
  - Locale is embedded in URL path (`/hr/`, `/de/`, etc.) so standard URL-based edge caching naturally separates locales. No custom cache key logic needed.
- **Constraints:** CON-PERF
- **Priority:** P1
- **Dependencies:** REQ-CMS-1
- **Verification:** Check cache headers, multi-region response times
- **Status:** Planned

### REQ-PERF-3: Bundle Budget

- **Intent:** Minimal JS shipped to visitors
- **Applies To:** System
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Astro islands: JS only for lightbox, inquiry form, availability calendar, optional GSAP
  - Total JS < 80KB gzipped (visitor pages)
  - GSAP (if used): loaded only on pages that need it, code-split
  - Interactive map (if introduced in P2): lazy-loaded on scroll into viewport
  - No JS framework for static content sections
  - Admin bundle separate from visitor bundle
- **Constraints:** CON-PERF
- **Priority:** P1
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Verification:** Bundle analysis
- **Status:** Planned

## Out of Scope

- PWA / Service Worker (unnecessary for this scale)
- Full offline-first architecture
- Background sync
- Push notifications

## Domain Dependencies

- CMS (media storage, cache invalidation)
- All visitor-facing domains (bundle contribution)

# Performance

Image serving, edge caching, bundle budget.

## Key Concepts

- **Image serving**: Images served as-is from private R2 via Worker route — no edge resizing or format conversion currently applied
- **Edge caching**: Static pages cached at Cloudflare's global edge network for sub-second delivery
- **Bundle budget**: Maximum JS size shipped to visitors (< 80KB gzipped)
- **Blurhash**: Compact placeholder encoding shown before full image loads

## Requirements

### REQ-PERF-1: Image Serving Pipeline

- **Intent:** Fast, beautiful images from phone photos without Worker-side processing
- **Applies To:** System
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Originals stored in private R2 (no processing in Worker — memory/CPU limits)
  - **Image delivery via Worker route** `GET /api/img/{key}` — Worker fetches from private R2 (via Emdash storage abstraction with direct R2 fallback) and returns the original image as-is. No Cloudflare Image Resizing applied (no format conversion, no responsive widths). Object keys are R2 identifiers in one of two forms: `UUID.ext` (the standard format produced by `POST /admin/api/upload-url` and the Emdash media library, e.g. `aa0fd53c-5d96-4a78-a5b5-0f68b543515a.jpg`) and bare extension-less UUIDs (legacy hero carousel keys, e.g. `d57cdaef-2625-448e-bd51-5bdc90de4883`, predating the `UUID.ext` standard). The route accepts both forms because content type is read from R2 object metadata, not from the key suffix. Keys containing path traversal sequences (`..`) or leading slashes are rejected with 400.
  - Responsive `<picture>` with `srcset` at 400, 800, 1200, 1920px widths
  - Format negotiation: not implemented (images served in original format)
  - **Blurhash:** Computed client-side in CMS admin UI for new uploads (lightweight JS library). Computed at seed time for preloaded content. Stored as metadata string in D1. (No background task or Worker-side computation.)
  - Lazy loading (`loading="lazy"`) below fold
  - Hero first image: `loading="eager"` + `<link rel="preload">` + `fetchpriority="high"`
  - Subsequent Ken Burns images: lazy-loaded in background after first paint
  - **Failure modes:**
    - R2 fetch failure: show blurhash placeholder with alt text (no Image Resizing fallback needed since images are already served as originals)
    - Original not found in R2: show blurhash placeholder with alt text. No broken image icon.
    - Blurhash missing: show solid color placeholder (dominant palette color from CSS custom properties)
  - Target: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1
- **Constraints:** CON-PERF, CON-MEDIA
- **Priority:** P0
- **Dependencies:** REQ-CMS-2
- **Verification:** Lighthouse audit on 4G throttle
- **Status:** Partial — R2 serving route implemented at `/api/img/[key]` with long-lived immutable cache headers and error handling. Fetches via Emdash storage abstraction with direct R2 bucket fallback. 142+ real photos uploaded to R2 (the gallery page alone references 142 unique photos; additional photos used by hero carousel, triptych, editorial sections, and apartment interiors). Most keys use `UUID.ext` format; the 7 hard-coded hero carousel keys are bare extension-less UUIDs (legacy from before the `UUID.ext` standard) — both forms are served correctly because content type comes from R2 object metadata. All site images (hero, subpage heroes, gallery, content) served from R2 via `/api/img/{key}`. R2 access credentials (`R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) configured as Worker secrets. Zero stock photos remain. Images served as-is from R2 (no Image Resizing, no format conversion, no responsive widths). Blurhash, responsive `<picture>`, and format negotiation not yet implemented.

### REQ-PERF-2: Edge Caching

- **Intent:** Sub-second responses worldwide
- **Applies To:** System
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Static pages (homepage, apartments, editorial) cached at edge with `stale-while-revalidate`
  - **Root `/` is NOT shared-cacheable** — performs personalized locale redirect (`302`) based on: 1) locale cookie, 2) `Accept-Language`, 3) Croatian default
  - Dynamic routes (admin, API, form submission, `/api/track`, `/api/apartments/*/availability`) bypass cache
  - **Availability calendar data fetched client-side** via uncached API endpoint. Calendar shell renders statically; dates/pricing loaded on mount via JS. Prevents stale availability in cached pages.
  - Cache purged on content update from CMS (via Cache API)
  - Media from R2 via Worker route: cached at edge with long TTL (immutable)
  - Locale is embedded in URL path (`/hr/`, `/de/`, etc.) so standard URL-based edge caching naturally separates locales. No custom cache key logic needed.
  - **Static asset caching via `_headers` file:** content-hashed Astro assets (`/_astro/*`) cached immutably (1 year); fonts (`.woff2`, `.woff`) cached 30 days; R2 image API responses (`/api/img/*`) cached 1 day with 7-day stale-while-revalidate; favicons and static images cached 30 days; HTML pages cached 1 hour with 1-day stale-while-revalidate. API routes (sitemap, robots.txt, image serving) set their own Cache-Control headers in response code.
- **Constraints:** CON-PERF
- **Priority:** P1
- **Dependencies:** REQ-CMS-1
- **Verification:** Check cache headers, multi-region response times
- **Status:** Partial — static asset caching headers defined via `_headers` file (content-hashed assets, fonts, images, HTML) and per-route Cache-Control in API responses. Edge caching strategy for dynamic content still planned.

### REQ-PERF-3: Bundle Budget

- **Intent:** Minimal JS shipped to visitors
- **Applies To:** System
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Astro islands: JS only for lightbox, inquiry form, availability calendar, optional GSAP
  - Total JS < 80KB gzipped (visitor pages)
  - GSAP (if used): loaded only on pages that need it, code-split
  - Interactive map (if introduced in P2): lazy-loaded on scroll into viewport
  - No JS framework for static content sections
  - Admin bundle separate from visitor bundle
- **Constraints:** CON-PERF
- **Priority:** P1
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Verification:** Bundle analysis
- **Status:** Planned

## Out of Scope

- PWA / Service Worker (unnecessary for this scale). Note: a lightweight `site.webmanifest` exists for home-screen icon and browser chrome (REQ-SEO-10), but no service worker, offline support, or app-like PWA behavior is implemented.
- Full offline-first architecture
- Background sync
- Push notifications

## Domain Dependencies

- CMS (media storage, cache invalidation)
- All visitor-facing domains (bundle contribution)

# Apartments

Apartment listings, detail pages, photo galleries, amenities, seasonal pricing, and availability calendars.

## Key Concepts

- **Listing**: Card-based overview of all apartments
- **Detail page**: Full presentation — gallery, amenities, pricing, availability, inquiry widget
- **Amenity**: Structured boolean field with icon (AC, WiFi, parking, etc.)
- **Seasonal pricing**: Price bands by date range (peak, shoulder, off-peak)
- **Availability**: Calendar showing booked/available dates per apartment

## Requirements

### REQ-AP-1: Apartment Collection Schema

- **Intent:** Define the data model for apartments in Emdash CMS
- **Applies To:** Owner, System
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - **Per-locale fields:** name, slug, short description, full description (Portable Text), one-line value proposition ("Best for couples with sea view terrace"), SEO title, SEO description
  - **Identity:** max occupancy (total adults + children), max children within occupancy, bedroom count, bathroom count, area (m2), floor/level, apartment naming (e.g., "Apartment Tramuntana")
  - **Bed configuration:** structured list — each entry: room name, bed type (double/single/sofa bed/bunk/crib), bed dimensions (e.g., "160x200cm"), count
  - **Distances:** distance to nearest beach (meters, walking), beach type (pebble/sand/rocky/concrete), distance to nearest shop (meters), distance to nearest restaurant (meters), distance to ferry Tkon (km), distance to Ždrelac bridge (km). Methodology noted: "walking distance" vs "straight line"
  - **Detailed amenities:**
    - Climate: AC type (whole unit / bedroom only / split units), heating
    - Connectivity: WiFi (yes/no + approximate speed if known), TV, satellite
    - Kitchen: full kitchen / kitchenette, fridge, oven, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine type (filter/espresso/capsule), toaster, kettle, cooking utensils, tableware for X persons
    - Bathroom: shower / bathtub, hair dryer, washing machine location (in-unit / shared), iron
    - Outdoor: balcony/terrace (with size in m2 and furnishing), sea view quality (full / partial / none), BBQ type (stone / gas / charcoal), garden/yard access
    - Parking: type (private / street / reserved), vehicle count, covered (yes/no), distance from apartment
    - Access: floor level, stairs only / elevator, step-free access, number of steps
    - Policies: pet-friendly (with conditions/extra fee), smoking (indoor no / outdoor terrace ok), max occupancy strictly enforced
    - Child amenities: crib available, high chair, baby bath, child safety (balcony railing height, pool fence if applicable)
  - **House rules:** quiet hours, check-in/out times, party policy, additional guest policy. Per-locale rich text.
  - **Media:** ordered photo gallery (min 5, max 30), optional floor plan image
  - **Pricing:** linked seasonal pricing entries + optional per-stay cleaning fee
  - **Availability:** booked date ranges
  - **Status:** published/draft per locale independently
  - **Sort order** for listing page
  - **"Best for" labels:** owner selects from: couples, families, remote workers, groups, nature lovers. Displayed on listing cards.
- **Constraints:** CON-CMS, CON-I18N
- **Priority:** P0
- **Dependencies:** REQ-CMS-1, REQ-I18N-4
- **Verification:** Create test apartment in admin on phone, verify all fields render
- **Status:** Deprecated - not needed for MVP

### REQ-AP-2: Apartment Listing Page

- **Intent:** Let visitors browse and compare all apartments at a glance
- **Applies To:** Visitor
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - **Current implementation:** Card grid showing apartments from Emdash CMS (with hardcoded fallback data when CMS is not yet seeded). Each card is a full-card link (`<a>` wrapping the entire card) to the apartment detail page (`/{locale}/apartmani/{slug}`). Card contents: hero photo (3:2 aspect, `object-fit: cover`), name, tagline (italic), meta row (sleeps count, size in m2, beach distance in meters), "Best for" badge (navy uppercase overlay on image), price ("from EUR X/night"), and inquiry CTA button. 2-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile. Cards have hover shadow lift and subtle image zoom (1.03x). Uses `HeroSimple` photo-backed header (REQ-VD-12). Below the grid, a `ScrollCollage` exterior photo strip is rendered when the `editorial` CMS entry (`page_key=homepage`, `section_key=collage`) is present — the same collage entry used on the homepage. Inquiry section below the collage with CTA linking to `/{locale}/kontakt` (REQ-BK-8).
  - **No fallback:** When Emdash returns no apartments (CMS not seeded), the listing page renders an empty grid. Hardcoded example apartments have been removed — all content comes from CMS only.
  - **With full CMS (planned):** sea view badge if applicable, one-line value proposition, link to detail page
  - Cards link to detail page
  - Quick-compare key facts visible on cards without clicking through
  - Image hover: subtle zoom within overflow:hidden
  - Scroll-triggered staggered fade-up entry
  - If only 1 apartment exists, listing page redirects to detail page
  - **If zero apartments published in current locale:** empty grid renders (CMS-only, no fallback content)
  - 2-column grid on desktop (cards), single column on mobile
  - Only shows apartments published in current locale
- **Constraints:** CON-PERF, CON-I18N
- **Priority:** P0
- **Dependencies:** REQ-AP-1
- **Verification:** Visual review with 0, 1, and 3+ apartments
- **Status:** Implemented

### REQ-AP-3: Apartment Detail Page

- **Intent:** Give the visitor everything needed to decide and inquire
- **Applies To:** Visitor
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - **Route:** `/{locale}/apartmani/{slug}` — dynamic route. Validates locale and slug; redirects to listing page if apartment not found or slug missing. Redirects to `/hr/` if locale is invalid.
  - **Current implementation (partial):**
    1. Hero: 60vh image (min 400px) with gradient overlay (transparent 40% to navy 75%), apartment name and tagline overlaid at bottom-left
    2. Interior photo collage: `ScrollCollage` strip (speed 25) rendered between breadcrumbs and the details section, sourced from the `gallery` CMS field (JSON array of R2 URLs). Interior photos only — exterior/terrace/BBQ photos are reserved for the listing page and homepage collages. Renders only when `gallery` is populated.
    3. Description: plain text from CMS `description` field
    4. Meta grid: 2-column grid on stone background (12px radius) showing sleeps, bedrooms, size (m2), beach distance — locale-aware labels
    5. "Best for" line below meta grid
    6. Sidebar: price card (white, 16px radius, shadow) showing "from EUR X/night" with locale-aware label, inquiry CTA button linking to listing page inquiry section
    7. Sidebar: amenities checklist (2-column grid on stone background, checkmark prefix) parsed from `amenities_json` field
    8. Back-to-apartments CTA in alt-background section
    9. Responsive: single column on mobile, 1.5fr/1fr grid on desktop (768px+ breakpoint)
  - **Visual hierarchy (full target, top to bottom):**
    1. Hero: apartment name, key stats strip (guests, bedrooms, m2, beach distance, "Best for" label)
    2. ~~Photo gallery (REQ-AP-6)~~ — Deprecated; replaced by `ScrollCollage` infinite-scroll collage below hero (see current implementation item 2)
    3. Description: Portable Text rendered from Emdash
    4. ~~Pricing table + availability calendar side by side on desktop (REQ-AP-4, REQ-AP-5)~~ — Deprecated
    5. ~~Inline inquiry widget pre-filled with this apartment (REQ-BK-1)~~ — Deprecated; inquiry via contact page (REQ-BK-8)
    6. ~~Trust: direct booking benefits strip (REQ-BK-5)~~ — Deprecated + contextual testimonial snippet (REQ-SP-1)
    7. Detailed amenities grid: icon + label, grouped by category (climate, kitchen, bathroom, outdoor, access)
    8. Bed configuration: visual diagram with bed types and dimensions
    9. House rules: check-in/out times, quiet hours, policies
    10. Floor plan: optional zoomable image
    11. Contextual FAQs (REQ-ED-7)
  - Trust info near inquiry widget: response time, no payment required, no obligation, cancellation summary
  - Contextual objection handling: common concerns answered inline (beach quality, parking, AC, stairs, noise, ferry stress)
  - Sticky mobile CTA at bottom
  - Breadcrumb navigation (REQ-SEO-1 BreadcrumbList schema + visible breadcrumb UI)
  - Schema.org `VacationRental` structured data per apartment (REQ-SEO-1)
- **Constraints:** CON-PERF, CON-A11Y, CON-I18N
- **Priority:** P0
- **Dependencies:** REQ-AP-1
- **Verification:** Full visual review + screen reader test. Verify detail page loads reliably for all apartment slugs in all 4 locales. Verify breadcrumbs and Schema.org render.
- **Status:** Partial — Breadcrumbs component now renders visible breadcrumb UI and BreadcrumbList schema on apartment detail pages; Schema.org VacationRental JSON-LD applied via SchemaOrg component; inline SVG wave added at hero bottom; lowestPrice passed to Page layout for sticky mobile CTA. Fallback apartment data (Lavanda, Tramuntana) now renders on detail pages when CMS not seeded — locale-aware names, taglines, descriptions, and amenities. Inline ternaries replaced with t() calls for bedrooms, price label, night, amenities title. Pricing table, availability calendar, gallery lightbox, and booking widget dependencies removed (REQ-AP-4, REQ-AP-5, REQ-AP-6, REQ-BK-1 deprecated). Interior photo gallery replaced by `ScrollCollage` (sourced from `gallery` CMS field, speed 25); exterior photos separated to listing page collage and homepage collage (REQ-VD-15). Pending live verification.

### REQ-AP-4: Seasonal Pricing

- **Intent:** Display transparent, season-based pricing
- **Applies To:** Visitor, Owner
- **Acceptance Criteria:**

  - Optional per-stay cleaning fee per apartment
  - Tourist tax rate configurable in CMS (default per Croatian regulations), children under 12 exempt
  - Prices in EUR, displayed with locale-appropriate formatting (`Intl.NumberFormat`)

  - Cleaning fee and tourist tax shown as separate line items below table
  - "All prices are estimates. Final price confirmed upon booking." disclaimer
  - German locale: total price including all mandatory fees shown prominently (PAngV compliance — German pricing transparency law)
  - If visitor selects dates in inquiry widget, itemized total computed (see REQ-BK-1)
  - **If no valid current/future season pricing exists:** hide "from €X/night" on listing card, show "Price on request" instead. Inquiry widget still usable (Quick Question tab).
  - **Publish validation warning** if next 12 months have pricing gaps
  - Owner can update prices from phone — simple numeric fields, no complex UI
- **Constraints:** CON-CMS, CON-I18N
- **Priority:** P0
- **Dependencies:** REQ-AP-1, REQ-CMS-1
- **Verification:** Test price computation across season boundaries
- **Status:** Deprecated - no pricing on site, guests ask via inquiry

### REQ-AP-5: Availability Calendar

- **Intent:** Let visitors see available dates instantly
- **Applies To:** Visitor, Owner

  - Visual month grid per apartment, 2 months on desktop, 1 on mobile
  - Booked dates: greyed out, not selectable, distinguished by color AND pattern (not color-only)
  - Available dates: clickable, highlight on hover/tap
  - Selecting check-in + check-out pre-fills inquiry form dates
  - Owner marks dates as booked from CMS (date range picker on phone)
  - Calendar updates without full page reload
  - **Failure mode — data fetch failure:** If availability API returns error, calendar renders all dates as "available" with subtle banner: "Live availability may be unavailable. Please confirm dates in your inquiry." Inquiry form remains usable.
  - **Failure mode — stale data:** Calendar data fetched client-side via uncached API (REQ-PERF-2). If JS fails to load or execute, static calendar shell shows "Enable JavaScript to check availability" with direct inquiry link.
- **Constraints:** CON-CMS, CON-PERF, CON-A11Y
- **Priority:** P0
- **Dependencies:** REQ-AP-1, REQ-CMS-1
- **Verification:** Test date selection, test across month boundaries

- **Constraints:** CON-PERF, CON-A11Y, CON-MEDIA
- **Priority:** P0
- **Dependencies:** REQ-AP-1, REQ-CMS-2
